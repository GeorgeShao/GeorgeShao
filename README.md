# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm George Shao 

I study Computer Science @ University of Waterloo.

I've worked at Drop and ETHGlobal, and I'll be joining X (Twitter) in Winter 2025.

Read my engineering blog at [www.shao.zip](https://shao.zip)

Get in touch with me at [GeorgeShao123@gmail.com](mailto:GeorgeShao123@gmail.com)

Most of my work is in private repositories, but I enjoy contributing to open-source projects every once in a while.
